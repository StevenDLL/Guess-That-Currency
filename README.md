# Guess-That-Currency

An unfinished and most likely horribly coded "game" i made using Java/JavaFX. I plan on maybe remaking/fixing/continuing this project at some point this year.

ps:
>If you take the time to look through the code you will see that all the images are missing and thats because I used free Icons from over at https://www.flaticon.com/ but I havent taken the time to go back and get the profile links for the creators of said images so I'd rather not include them.
